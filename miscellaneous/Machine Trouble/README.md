# Machine Trouble

tag: medium e4stw1nd

I don't think even smart people like you can get the flag out of such a machine with so little memory. Prove me wrong. If you find it, enclose the flag in pearl{}.

NOTE: Flag does not have any upper case character and number.

## Solve

We are welcome with this, which is the true problem

Welcome to The Finite State Machine:
=======================RULES===========================
The flag is set as the input string, and the alphabets of the language are set to a-z, {, }, _.
Here, you can define your own states and transitions.
If there is no defined transition for a particular letter, then the machine gets trapped.
It must be a DFA, not an NFA.
An output of 1 means that the string is present in the language; 0 means otherwise.
'@' takes the machine from one state to another by consuming any one letter.
'~l' takes the machine from one state to another by consuming one letter unless the letter is 'l'.
Example: '5 @ 6' takes the machine from state 5 to state 6 for all letters.
Example: '6 ~b 7' takes the machine from state 6 to state 7 for all letters except 'b'.
=================================================
Enter number of states:
```

What we can do is rather simple, we new create a machine that run on the flag, what this mean is
- We chose our machine
    - have how much state `S` - Zero index
    - stated state alway set to 0
    - (at least one) final states `f[] = [...]`
    - how much transitor `T`
    - define exact transition with two type `t[] = [...]`
        - '@' consume a character (which I assumming we running on flag character here)
        - '~a' consume a character unless the letter is 'a'
        - Each transitor can tranform a state to other state with one of either type 

Now let start with a string, and a defined machine

- This machine jump state one by one, with any character

    ```python
    length = 11
    t = ["".join([str(i), ' @ ', str(i+1)]) for i in range(length-1)]
    T = len(t)
    S = len(t) + 1
    f = [S - 1]

    print(S)
    print(" ".join([str(i) for i in f]))
    print(T)

    for line in t:
        print(line)
    ```

    Not thing much, I trial and error until i found a length where it not stuck

- This machine not allow a single character

    > the alphabets of the language are set to a-z, {, }, _.

    ```python
    # ...
    t = ["".join([str(i), ' ~b ', str(i+1)]) for i in range(length-1)]
    # ...
    ```

    So we update the code that automate this process for us, base on the final byte return by nc
    ```python
    import time
    import socket


    class Netcat:
        """ Python 'netcat like' module """

        def __init__(self, ip, port):
            self.buff = ""
            self.socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            self.socket.connect((ip, port))

        def read(self, length=1024):
            """ Read 1024 bytes off the socket """
            return self.socket.recv(length)

        def read_until(self, data):
            """ Read data into the buffer until we have data """
            while data not in self.buff:
                self.buff += self.socket.recv(1024).decode("ascii")

            pos = self.buff.find(data)
            rval = self.buff[:pos + len(data)]
            self.buff = self.buff[pos + len(data):]

            return rval

        def write(self, data):
            self.socket.send(data)

        def close(self):
            self.socket.close()


    def crafted(f=None, position=None):
        result = ""
        length = 11
        t = ["".join([str(i), ' @ ', str(i+1)]) for i in range(length-1)]
        if f is not None:
            if position is not None:
                t[position] = "".join([str(position), f' ~{f} ', str(position+1)])
            else:
                t = ["".join([str(i), f' ~{f} ', str(i+1)])
                     for i in range(length-1)]

        T = len(t)
        S = len(t) + 1
        f = [S - 1]

        result += str(S) + '\n'
        result += " ".join([str(i) for i in f]) + '\n'
        result += str(T) + '\n'
        for line in t:
            result += line + '\n'
        return result


    # whitelist = "_acdefhk"
    for i in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        s = Netcat('dyn.ctf.pearlctf.in', 30018)

        data = bytes(crafted(i), 'ascii')
        s.write(data)
        time.sleep(3)
        buf = s.read()
        buf = s.read()
        print(i, buf[-2])
        s.close()
    ```

    output, i seperate those with b"49"
    ```python
    a 46
        b 49
    c 46
    d 46
    e 46
    f 46
        g 49
    h 46
        i 49
        j 49
    k 46
        l 49
        m 49
        n 49
        o 49
        p 49
        q 49
        r 49
        s 49
        t 49
        u 49
        v 49
        w 49
        x 49
        y 49
        z 49
    ```

    I can test that we not have character
    ```python
    blacklist = "bgijl..z{},"
    whitelist = "_acdefhk"
    ```

- Final step, just try and error every character, the helper function already cover it so all we have is just update some param
    ```python
    whitelist = "_acdefhk"
    result = ""
    for pos in range(11):
        for i in whitelist:
            s = Netcat('dyn.ctf.pearlctf.in', 30018)

            data = bytes(crafted(i, pos), 'ascii')
            s.write(data)
            time.sleep(3)
            buf = s.read()
            buf = s.read()
            print(pos, i, buf[-2])
            if buf[-2] == 46:
                result += i
                break
            s.close()
    ```

    output that I already trim-out b"49"
    ```python
    0 d 46
    1 f 46
    2 a 46
    3 _ 46
    4 h 46
    5 a 46
    6 c 46
    7 k 46
    8 e 46
    9 d 46
    ```
